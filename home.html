        <p>
          "Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?," also known as "Carmen Sandiego's
          Great Chase Through Time," is a remake of the 1989 game of the same
          name.

        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>
          The opening cutscene shows Carmen Sandiego and her band of V.I.L.E.
          time thieves bursting into ACME Headquarters. After entering ACME Time
          Net, Carmen makes off with the Chronoskimmer, a device that allows the
          user to travel through time. Carmen uses the Chronoskimmer to send her
          crooks to different times and places in history to steal historical
          objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          ACME's newest recruit (the player) tracks down the time thieves by
          using Time Tunnels left behind by the Chronoskimmer. For each case,
          the player has to identify the thefts, solve any problems and arrest
          the thief responsible with the Time Cuffs. The thieves are always
          given a note telling them where to hide, and the player can use the
          note scraps (and the Chronopedia) to deduce the hiding places.
        </p>
        <p>
          With each case solved, the player draws closer to recovering the
          Chronoskimmer and ultimately tracking down Carmen.
